# Gulp & Webpack Boilerplate
The defualt file is `gulpfile.babel.js` if you're having problems running it use `gulpfile.bkup.js`.<br> 
Remove `gulpfile'.bkup'.js` and add `.bkup` to `gulpfile.babel.js`, (eg `gulpfile.babel.bkup.js`)<br>
this removes the config file from gulps scope, `.bkup` can be replaced with any name. 

## Gulp
Current setup has 2 tasks `dev` and `build`. The default task is `dev` It will run `browsersync` to watch and update files,<br>
if you want to run the production build the `build` task is using `minimist` to set environment variables to run the build tasks.
* `gulp build --type prod`

For developent there are 3 options.
* `gulp --debug true` runs scss minify and source maps.
* `gulp --clean true` runs scss minify.
* `gulp --source true` outputs a source map.

## HTML
HTML live loading (`bs-html-injector`) is enabled by default, there is currently no terminal logging support. If you would like to disable live reload and enable standard browser sync page refresh comment out `bs.use(htmlInjector)` and uncomment code bellow in `gulpfile.bable.js` or `gulpfile.js`.
```js
  gulp.watch(paths.markup.src, gulp.series(reload))
    .on('change', (path, stats) => {
      log(`File ${path} was changed`);
      // code to execute on change
    })
    .on('unlink', (path, stats) => {
      log(`File ${path} was removed`);
      // code to execute on delete
    });
```
